## Machine Learning: Linear Regression Lab
This is the first time I have shared my study process of Machine Learning Class in the medium. I hope to share my story continuously and push myself to learn and develop.

I will introduce my first assignment on ML.

In this experiment, we'll delve into the basic concepts of linear regression, including the problem statement, dataset loading, visualization, and implementation of key algorithms.

# Experiment Objective
The objective of this experiment is to understand how linear regression can be used to predict profits for a restaurant franchise based on city population. We'll explore the dataset, visualize the relationship between city population and profits, and implement linear regression algorithms to make accurate predictions.

# Experiment Steps
  1. Problem Statement: We'll start by understanding the problem at hand, which involves predicting profits for a restaurant franchise in different cities based on population data. 

  2. Dataset Loading: Next, we'll load the dataset containing information about city populations and corresponding profits. This dataset will serve as the basis for our analysis and model training.

  3. Data Visualization: We'll create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between city population and profits. Visualization helps us understand the data distribution and identify patterns.

  4. Linear Regression Theory: Before diving into implementation, we'll briefly review the theory behind linear regression. This includes understanding the model equation, cost function, and gradient descent algorithm.

  5. Implementation of Cost Function: We'll implement a function to calculate the cost associated with different parameters of the linear regression model. This cost function serves as the measure of error between predicted and actual values.
  *Note: When you finish your coding, you can run and check the result.
  
  6. Gradient Descent Algorithm: We'll implement the gradient descent algorithm, which is used to optimize the parameters of the linear regression model. Gradient descent helps us find the parameters that minimize the cost function.
  *Note: When you finish your coding, you can run and check the result.
  
  7. Model Training: Using the implemented algorithms, we'll train the linear regression model on the dataset. This involves iteratively adjusting the model parameters to minimize the cost function.
  
  8. Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, we'll evaluate its performance by visualizing the linear fit on top of the scatter plot. This allows us to assess how well the model fits the data.
  
  9. Making Predictions: Finally, we'll use the trained model to make predictions on new data points. We'll predict profits for cities with different population sizes and interpret the results.

# Conclusion
By completing this experiment, we'll gain a practical understanding of linear regression and its application in predictive modeling. Linear regression is a foundational technique in machine learning and data analysis, and mastering it opens the door to more advanced algorithms and real-world applications.Â
